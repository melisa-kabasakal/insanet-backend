## Frontend Migration Note

The frontend of this project was originally developed with Vanilla JavaScript.  
It was later fully refactored and migrated to React by the same developer to improve scalability, state management, and user experience.  
The React version includes Context API, protected routes, and modular structure.

> The frontend repository is private due to business requirements but can be demonstrated upon request.
